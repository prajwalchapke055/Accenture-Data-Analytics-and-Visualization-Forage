# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Forage
NAVIGATING NUMBERS - Apply your data analytics &amp; visualization skills to advise a social media client on their content creation strategy as a Data Analyst at Accenture

## Task 1: Project Understanding

Read the brief from Social Buzz
Your first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call. 
One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

Read the brief to:
Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

Complete the knowledge check to move onto the next step. You can attempt each question in the knowledge check as many times as you like!

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

First up, requirements gathering
As we mentioned, you have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.
Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
When you think you’ve identified the right data sets to include, complete the multi choice quiz to move onto the next step.

Question 1 of 1
Which three data sets will you need to complete your analysis?
Answer : Reaction, Content, Reaction Types
Great work! Your job is to identify which content categories are most popular. Popularity is determined based on reaction scores.

**Data Cleaning**
Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.

**Data Modelling**
Okay, we’re nearly there! You’re doing a great job. 
Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together
We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories
Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula
The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:
A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories : Once you have a final data file, upload it to complete this task! We'll provide you with some explanation videos in the next step - but first give it a go to see if you can figure it out. 

You can use Excel or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set.

## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling

**Build your presentation Structure**
Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.
Here is a template that we would use at Accenture to create a presentation. You need to download this template and populate slides 2-6.

For each slide, think about: 
  Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
  Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
  Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
  The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
  As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
  Process - How did you complete your analysis?

Once you’ve populated slides 2-6 - complete the quick knowledge check to move onto the next step.

In the next step, we’ll review what you’ve included before we start charting.

**Data Visualization Explained**

Nice work completing the data visualization exercise!
Like we’ve said, it’s important to keep your presentation simple and clean - take a look at the annotated example images to see how you could have visualized the data. 
You could have done it differently, and that’s okay! There are lots of different ways that you can bring data to life.
Now let’s go to your final step where you will practice your presentation skills!

## Task 4: Present to the Client

**Presentation tips**

When presenting to the client there are a few things that you should remember:
They may not all be familiar with data, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language.
You want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and language relevant to the task.
This is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.
 
A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.
 
Let’s keep going, you’re nearly finished!

**Record your video**

It is now time to record your presentation to the client.
Remember, your presentation should be concise, engaging and should tell a compelling story. It should be no longer than 10 minutes.
Recording the video may require a few attempts until you’re happy with it, but this task shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes.
While the recording functionality in this task won't allow you to share your slides as you speak, it will help you learn how to communicate and use eye contact when presenting.
Great work on your presentation.
